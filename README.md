# Worms_Port

Worms_Port is an MIT-licensed Phaser project bootstrapped from the MIT
`TurtlePU/worms-ii` code base.

## Import Boundary

- `TurtlePU/worms-ii` is the approved base code source. Its MIT notice is
  preserved in `LICENSE` and `legal/source-manifest.json`.
- `lorgan3/sorcerers` is a quarantined reference/archive only. No Sorcerers
  code or bulk assets are imported into the product tree.
- Assets from Sorcerers may move into `assets/` only after exact-file license
  evidence proves commercial use, redistribution, and modification are allowed.
- Product assets must be traceable through `legal/asset-manifest.json`.

## Asset Policy

The default allowed bucket is strict: CC0, public domain, permissive code
licenses, CC-BY with attribution, or paid/owned assets with explicit commercial
rights. NonCommercial, personal-use-only, unclear, GPL/AGPL/LGPL, CC-BY-SA,
no-redistribution, and branded/derivative IP assets are blocked for product use.

Run the compliance gate before importing or committing assets:

```sh
npm run check:compliance
```

## Build

Use Node.js 20 or newer.

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

The browser client builds with Vite into `client/build/`. The Node server builds
with esbuild into `server/build/server.js`.
