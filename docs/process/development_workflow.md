# Development Workflow

Worms_Port should move in small, auditable slices. The main engineering risk is
not only a bug; it is accidentally weakening the license/import boundary while
adding gameplay, assets, or tooling.

## Source Of Truth

Use these files to decide where a change belongs:

- `README.md` for setup, build, and high-level repo status.
- `AGENTS.md` for Codex operating rules and subagent roles.
- `docs/import-boundary.md` for upstream source roles.
- `docs/asset-review-workflow.md` for third-party asset review.
- `docs/planning/implementation_plan.md` for current slices and role routing.
- `legal/source-manifest.json` for upstream source traceability.
- `legal/asset-manifest.json` for approved product assets.
- `legal/allowed-licenses.json` for asset license policy.
- `legal/dependency-license-overrides.json` for npm package license evidence.

## Required Development Loop

Every non-trivial change should follow this loop:

1. **Plan the slice**
   Define the intended behavior, owning role, affected files, non-goals, and
   import-boundary risk.
2. **Plan the checks**
   Decide whether to run compliance, typecheck, build, audit, smoke tests, or
   manual browser checks.
3. **Implement**
   Keep Turtle-derived code changes separate from asset review and compliance
   changes when practical.
4. **Verify**
   Run the planned checks and record results.
5. **Update docs/manifests**
   Update source, asset, attribution, planning, or workflow docs when the
   change alters repo truth.
6. **Summarize**
   Report files changed, checks run, skipped checks, and residual risk.

## Plan Change Protocol

If implementation shows that the plan is wrong or risky:

1. Stop expanding scope.
2. State the issue plainly.
3. Classify the risk:
   - import-boundary risk,
   - asset-license risk,
   - dependency-license risk,
   - build/runtime architecture issue,
   - gameplay/scope change,
   - test strategy gap.
4. Update the relevant source-of-truth document before or in the same commit as
   the implementation.
5. Ask the user before continuing if the change would import new GPL/unclear
   material, change the project license, or materially expand scope.

## Subagent Coordination

Use `.codex/agents/` roles as scoped workers. They coordinate through repo
artifacts:

- planning docs define work slices,
- manifests record source and license evidence,
- commits preserve reviewed changes,
- completion summaries name affected future roles.

No role may override the Turtle/Sorcerers boundary.

## Definition Of Done

A slice is done when:

- it matches the requested behavior or documented plan,
- the import boundary still passes,
- relevant manifests/docs are current,
- planned checks have run,
- `npm run build` passes for source/tooling changes,
- final reporting names remaining risks.
